# Reinforcement Learning with OpenAI Gym

This repository contains Python code for implementing various reinforcement learning algorithms using the OpenAI Gym library. You can use these algorithms to train agents to solve different tasks and environments, focusing on the Frozen Lake environment as a primary example. The codebase demonstrates the application of foundational concepts in reinforcement learning such as policy evaluation, policy iteration, and Q-learning.

## Installation
To run this code, you will need Python 3.x and the following packages:
- `numpy`
- `gymnasium` (a fork of `gym`)
- `imageio`
- `IPython`

You can install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy gymnasium imageio IPython
```

## Usage
This section describes how to use the code to train reinforcement learning agents in the Frozen Lake environment.

## Random Walk
The random walk implementation demonstrates how an agent interacts with the environment without any specific policy. It simply takes random actions until the game ends or the maximum number of steps is reached.

## Policy Evaluation
Using the FrozenLakeMDP class, you can define the dynamics of the Frozen Lake environment. The policy_evaluation function allows you to evaluate a given policy's effectiveness in the environment.

## Policy Iteration
The policy_iteration function optimizes a policy by iteratively evaluating and improving it. It demonstrates how a policy converges to the optimal policy for the given environment dynamics.

## Q-Learning
The QAgent class implements the Q-learning algorithm, allowing the agent to learn an optimal policy through interaction with the environment. The train function facilitates the training process over a specified number of episodes.
